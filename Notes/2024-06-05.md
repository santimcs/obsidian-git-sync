2. Tap on the search bar at the top of the screen.
    
3. Enter your coordinates in one of the following formats:
    

- Decimal degrees (DD): This is the most common format and uses numbers separated by a comma. For example: 41.40338, 2.17403.

Google Maps will then center the map on the location specified by your coordinates.

Certainly! A **photo op** (short for **photograph opportunity**) refers to an arranged chance to take a photograph of a politician, celebrity, or event. The term was coined during the administration of US President Richard Nixon. It can have either a positive or negative connotation, depending on the context. [Often, photo ops involve carefully planned pseudo-events masquerading as news, such as politicians planting trees or visiting senior citizens to generate positive publicity](https://bing.com/search?q=Photo+ops)
