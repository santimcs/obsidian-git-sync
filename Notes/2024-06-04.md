In Line app, when a person sends a message of list of names and ask you to append your name, how to do?

Unfortunately, there's no built-in function within the Line app to directly modify a received message and add your name to it. However, you can achieve this by replying to the message with the following options:

1. **Reply with the entire list including your name:**

- Copy the entire list of names from the original message.
- Add your name to the end of the list.
- Reply to the message with the updated list.

2. **Quote the original message and add your name:**

- Tap and hold the message containing the list.
- Select "Quote" from the menu that appears.
- Type your name at the end of the quoted text.
- Send the reply.

I have tried copy as you suggested, now I can modify. But the problem is I do not send, now when I try to copy the latest message to modify, the old message is still there. How can I clear the old memory?

Line doesn't offer a way to directly clear the clipboard within the app itself. However, there are ways to work around this depending on your device (Android or iPhone) to get a fresh copy of the message list:

**On Android:**

1. **Use the notification bar:** If the message is still displayed in your notification bar, you can often tap and hold on the notification to access the full message. From there, you should be able to copy the text again, grabbing just the current list.
    
2. **Long press and select all:** Open the chat conversation. Tap and hold on the message containing the list. Instead of copying the entire message right away, try dragging the selection handles to encompass only the list itself. Then, select "Copy" from the menu.
    
3. **Use a keyboard app:** Some third-party keyboard apps for Android offer clipboard history management. If you have one installed, you might be able to access your previous copy and delete it before copying the updated list.
    

**On iPhone:**

1. **Force close the app:** Since iPhones don't have a traditional clipboard manager, you can try force closing the Line app to potentially clear the clipboard memory. Here's how (depending on your iPhone model):
    
    - **iPhone with Face ID:** Swipe up from the bottom of the screen and pause in the middle. Swipe up on the Line app preview to close it.
    - **iPhone with Home button:** Double-click the Home button and swipe up on the Line app preview to close it.
