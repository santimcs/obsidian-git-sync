### Revised Requirements:

1. **Omit the first row** where the date is 6 June 24.
    
2. **Extract and structure** data into the following columns:
    
    - Date
    - Time
    - Transaction
    - Channel
    - Amount
    - Available balance
    - 
1. **Modify the 'Amount' and 'Available balance' columns** to numeric format suitable for currency calculations.
    

### Process:

1. **Extract text from the PDF**:
    
    - Use a tool like `pdfplumber` to extract the raw text from the PDF.
2. **Parse the text to identify and structure the data**:
    
    - Use regular expressions to identify the relevant lines and capture the necessary details.
    - Handle specific rules such as:
        - Omitting the first row where the date is 6 June 24.
        - Setting the "Transaction" column to "Transfer in" if the line contains a `+` sign and "Transfer out" if the line contains a `-` sign.
        - Extracting the "Channel" information:
            - For "Transfer out" transactions, capture the entire string from the 6th element to the second-to-last element.
            - For "Transfer in" transactions, capture the entire string from the 6th element to the third-to-last element.
3. **Clean and convert the data**:
    
    - Remove any unnecessary characters (like '+' and '-' signs) from the 'Amount' column.
    - Convert the 'Amount' and 'Available balance' columns to numeric formats for currency calculations.
4. **Save the structured data to an Excel file**:
    
    - Use `pandas` to structure the data into a DataFrame.
    - Save the DataFrame to an Excel file with appropriate formatting.
