## How to save Google maps location to iPhone for later use?

You can save locations in Google Maps on your iPhone for later use by creating a starred list. Here's how:

1. Open the Google Maps app on your iPhone.
    
2. Search for the place you want to save, tap the marker, or tap and hold a spot on the map to bring up the location details.
    
3. At the bottom of the screen, you'll see the place's name or address. Tap on it.
    
4. This will open a new screen with details about the location. Look for a star icon (usually located at the top right corner).
    
5. Tap the star icon to save the location. You'll be prompted to choose a list or create a new one.
    

By creating a new list specifically for places you want to save for later, you can easily access them again. Here's how to access your saved locations:

1. Open the Google Maps app on your iPhone.
    
2. Tap the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner.
    
3. Tap "Your Lists" from the menu.
    
4. You'll see all your saved lists, including the one you created for places you want to visit later. Tap on that list to see the saved locations.
